# Wk4_EEMB-R-Workshop-phylogenetic-trees
This R code walks us through the basics of plotting and manipulating phylogenetic trees, and displaying trait data on a tree
Created by: Eleanor Caves (eleanor_caves@ucsb.edu) 

There are three files for this week's tutorial:
1) R Seminar Phylogenetic Trees.R: this is the code we'll be running, complete with annotations at each step
2) Burleigh_tree.tre: A phylogenetic tree we'll be manipulating, from: Burleigh, J.G., Kimball, R.T. and Braun, E.L., 2015. Building the avian tree of life using a large-scale, sparse supermatrix. Molecular phylogenetics and evolution, 84, pp.53-63.
3) Bird_Trait_Data.csv: a csv file with data on one discrete and one continuous trait for 85 bird species, which we'll be plotting onto the phylogeny.
